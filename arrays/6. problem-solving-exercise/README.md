# Array Topics:

## Basics of Arrays:

### Problem 1:

- Write a function that multiplies all elements in an array to find a total product.

### Problem 2:

- Write a function that finds the sum of all elements in an array.

### Problem 3:

- Write a function that separates only the even numbers from an array.

### Problem 4:

- Write a function that creates a new array by removing all negative numbers from an array.

### Problem 5:

- Write a function to check if a specific value exists in an array.

## Common Operations (Push, Pop, Shift, Unshift, Splice, Slice):

### Problem 6:

- Write a function that adds a specific value to the end of an array (push).

### Problem 7:

- Write a function that adds a specific value to the beginning of an array (unshift).

### Problem 8:

- Write a function that removes the last element from an array (pop).

### Problem 9:

- Write a function that removes the first element from an array (shift).

### Problem 10:

- Write a function that adds new elements to the middle of an array and removes existing ones (splice).

### Problem 11:

- Write a function that returns a specific part of an array as a new array (slice).

## Array Methods (forEach, map, filter, reduce, etc.):

### Problem 12:

- Write a function that doubles each element in an array and returns a new array (map).

### Problem 13:

- Write a function that prints each element in an array (forEach).

### Problem 14:

- Write a function that filters out only even numbers from an array (filter).

### Problem 15:

- Write a function that finds the sum of all numbers in an array (reduce).

### Problem 16:

- Write a function that checks if a specific value exists in an array (some).

### Problem 17:

- Write a function that checks if all elements in an array meet a specific condition (every).

### Problem 18:

- Write a function that fills part of an array with a specific value (fill).

### Problem 19:

- Write a function that copies a part of an array to another location within the same array (copyWithin).

### Problem 20:

- Write a function that flattens an array with nested arrays up to a specific depth (flat).

### Problem 21:

- Write a function that uses flatMap to map each element in an array and flatten the result by one level.

### Problem 22:

- Write a function that finds an element in an array using findLast that matches a certain condition.

### Problem 23:

- Write a function that retrieves an element from an array at a specified index using the at method.

## Two-pointer Technique:

### Problem 24:

- Given a sorted array, find two numbers whose sum equals a specified value.

### Problem 25:

- Write a function that removes duplicate elements from an array.

### Problem 26:

- Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome (i.e., the string reads the same backward).

### Problem 27:

- Write a function to find common elements between two arrays.

### Problem 28:

- Write a function that finds all unique pairs in a sorted array where the sum equals a target value.

## Sliding Window Approach:

### Problem 29:

- Given an array and a window size k, find the maximum sum within any consecutive k-sized elements.

### Problem 30:

- Given an array and a specified number, find the smallest subarray with a sum equal to or greater than that number.

### Problem 31:

- Write a function that checks if a specific value exists within any k-sized window in an array.

### Problem 32:

- Write a function to find the longest substring with all unique characters in a string.

### Problem 33:

- Given an array, find all windows with at least k unique elements.
