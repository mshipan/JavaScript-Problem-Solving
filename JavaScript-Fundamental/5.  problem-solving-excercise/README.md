### 1. Variables, Data Types, and Operators

# Problem 1:

Write a function convertTemperature that takes a temperature in Celsius and returns the temperature in Fahrenheit. Use the formula: Fahrenheit = (Celsius \* 9/5) + 32.

# Problem 2:

Create a program that checks if a given year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, except when it is divisible by 400.

# Problem 3:

Write a function calculateArea that calculates the area of a rectangle, circle, or triangle based on the shape type and relevant parameters. Use appropriate data types for the calculations.

### 2. Control Structures (if, else, switch)

# Problem 4:

Write a function gradeCalculator that takes a student's score as input and returns the grade based on the following criteria:

A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: below 60

# Problem 5:

Create a function weekdayName that takes a number (1-7) as input and returns the corresponding day of the week. Use a switch statement for this problem.

# Problem 6:

Write a program that determines whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero, and outputs an appropriate message.

### 3. Loops (for, while)

# Problem 7:

Write a function sumOfMultiples that calculates the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 below a given number.

# Problem 8:

Create a program that generates the first n Fibonacci numbers, where n is a positive integer input by the user.

# Problem 9:

Write a function reverseString that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed. Use a for loop to iterate over the string.

### 4. Functions (Declaration, Expression, Arrow Functions)

# Problem 10:

Write a function calculateFactorial using a function declaration that returns the factorial of a given number.

# Problem 11:

Create a function expression called isPrime that checks if a number is prime. The function should return true if the number is prime and false otherwise.

# Problem 12:

Use an arrow function to write a concise function square that takes a number as input and returns its square.

### 5. Understanding Execution Context and Hoisting

# Problem 13:

Write a program that demonstrates hoisting by declaring a function and a variable after they are used in the code. Explain the output.

# Problem 14:

Create a function that declares a variable inside an if block and attempts to access it outside the block. Analyze what happens and explain why.

# Problem 15:

Write a program that compares two functions: one declared with a function expression and the other with a function declaration. Call each function before it is defined in the code and observe the results.
