# ES6 Topics:

## 1. Let, Const, and Var:

### Problem 1:

- Write a function that demonstrates the difference between let, const, and var in terms of block scope, reassignment, and hoisting.

### Problem 2:

- Create a program that calculates the factorial of a number using let and const. Ensure that the program correctly handles variable scope.

## 2. Template Literals:

### Problem 3:

- Create a function that takes an array of user objects and returns a formatted string using template literals. Include the user's name, age, and occupation in the output.

### Problem 4:

- Write a function that generates a multiline string using template literals to describe a product's features, price, and availability.

## 3. Destructuring:

### Problem 5:

- Write a function that accepts an object representing a book (with properties like title, author, and year) and destructures it to log the details.

### Problem 6:

- Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the first, second, and rest of the elements using array destructuring.

## 4. Spread and Rest Operators:

### Problem 7:

- Create a function that merges two arrays of numbers into a single sorted array using the spread operator.

### Problem 8:

- Write a function that takes an indefinite number of arguments and returns their sum using the rest operator.

## 5. Classes and Modules:

### Problem 9:

- Create a Person class with properties for name, age, and occupation, and a method to return a greeting. Then, extend this class to create an Employee class that includes additional properties like employee ID and department.

### Problem 10:

- Write a module that exports a function for calculating the area of different shapes (circle, square, rectangle). Import this module into another file and use it to calculate areas.

# OOP Topics:

## 6. Encapsulation:

### Problem 11:

- Create a BankAccount class with private properties for balance and account number. Include methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance. Ensure that the balance cannot be directly accessed or modified outside the class.

## 7. Inheritance:

### problem 12:

- Create a Vehicle class with properties like make, model, and year. Then, extend this class to create a Car class that adds properties like number of doors and fuel type. Demonstrate how to use methods from both the base and derived classes.

## 8. Abstraction:

### problem 13:

- Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method calculateArea. Then, implement this method in derived classes like Circle, Square, and Rectangle to calculate the area of each shape.

## 9. Polymorphism:

### problem 14:

- Create a PaymentProcessor class with a method processPayment. Then, create derived classes like CreditCardProcessor, PayPalProcessor, and BankTransferProcessor that override the method to process payments differently. Demonstrate how polymorphism allows you to use these classes interchangeably.

## 10. Combined Topics:

### problem 15:

- Write a program that demonstrates the use of ES6 classes with inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create a simple inventory management system. The system should include classes for Product, Electronics, and Clothing, with methods for adding, removing, and displaying products.

### problem 16:

- Create a library management system using classes and modules. The system should include classes for Book, Member, and Librarian, and methods for borrowing, returning, and cataloging books. Use encapsulation to ensure that sensitive data like member information is protected.

## 11. Destructuring and Classes:

### problem 17:

- Create a Movie class with properties like title, director, and year. Then, write a function that takes an array of Movie objects and destructures each object to log the details.

## 12. Spread Operator and Inheritance:

### problem 18:

- Create a User class with properties like name and email. Extend this class to create an Admin class that adds additional properties like role and permissions. Use the spread operator to merge properties from two Admin objects into a new object.

## 13. Template Literals and Polymorphism:

### problem 19:

- Write a program that creates an Animal class with a method speak. Extend this class to create Dog and Cat classes that override the speak method. Use template literals to format the output of the speak method.

## 14. Rest Operator and Encapsulation:

### problem 20:

- Create a ShoppingCart class with private properties for items and total price. Include a method to add items to the cart using the rest operator, and another method to calculate the total price. Ensure that the items and total price cannot be accessed directly.

## 15. Classes and Modules:

### problem 21:

- Write a module that exports a class Calculator with methods for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Then, create another module that imports Calculator and uses it to perform complex calculations.
