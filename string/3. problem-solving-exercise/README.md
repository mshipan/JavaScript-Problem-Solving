# String Manipulation Techniques

#### Problem 1: String Concatenation

- Write a function `concatStrings` that takes two strings as input and returns a single concatenated string separated by a space.

#### Problem 2: Extracting Substring

- Write a function `getSubstring` that takes a string and two numbers (start index and end index) as input and returns the substring between those indices.

#### Problem 3: String Replacement

- Write a function `replaceWord` that takes a sentence, a word to replace, and a replacement word. Return the new sentence with all occurrences of the word replaced.

#### Problem 4: Changing Case

- Write a function `toggleCase` that takes a string and toggles the case of each character (uppercase becomes lowercase and vice versa).

#### Problem 5: String Trimming

- Write a function `trimExtraSpaces` that takes a string with extra spaces at the beginning and end and returns the trimmed version.

#### Problem 6: Splitting a String

- Write a function `splitStringByComma` that takes a string of comma-separated values and returns an array of those values.

#### Problem 7: Searching in a String

- Write a function `findWordIndex` that takes a sentence and a word, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the word in the sentence.

#### Problem 8: Repeating a String

- Write a function `repeatString` that takes a string and a number \( n \), and returns the string repeated \( n \) times.

#### Problem 9: Reversing a String

- Write a function `reverseString` that takes a string and returns it reversed.

# Common String Operations and Methods

#### Problem 10: String Padding

- Write a function `padString` that takes a string and two numbers (target length and padding type: "start" or "end") and returns the padded string.

#### Problem 11: Removing Specific Characters

- Write a function `removeVowels` that takes a string and returns the string with all vowels removed.

#### Problem 12: Removing Duplicates

- Write a function `removeDuplicateChars` that takes a string and returns the string after removing duplicate characters.

#### Problem 13: String Formatting

- Write a function `formatName` that takes a first name and last name as input and returns the formatted full name in the form: "Last, First".

#### Problem 14: Character Count

- Write a function `countOccurrences` that takes a string and a character, and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.

#### Problem 15: ASCII Value

- Write a function `asciiValues` that takes a string and returns an array of ASCII values for each character in the string.

#### Problem 16: Matching Patterns

- Write a function `findPattern` that takes a string and a pattern, and returns true if the pattern exists in the string.

#### Problem 17: Find Longest Word

- Write a function `longestWord` that takes a sentence and returns the longest word in it.

#### Problem 18: Count Words

- Write a function `wordCount` that takes a string and returns the number of words in it.

#### Problem 19: Check Palindrome

- Write a function `isPalindrome` that takes a string and returns true if it reads the same backward.

#### Problem 20: Convert String to Title Case

- Write a function `toTitleCase` that takes a sentence and returns the string with the first letter of each word capitalized.
